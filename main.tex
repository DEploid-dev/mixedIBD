\begin{abstract}
{\it Plasmodium falciparum} infections can be caused by multiple strains with a distinct genetic makeup. Within mixed infections, these genetic types can exhibit different levels of relatedness. However, how the rate and relatedness of such infections are influenced by local epidemiological parameters remains unclear.  Here, we develop an enhanced method for strain deconvolution from genome sequencing data, which estimates the number of strains, their proportions, relatedness profiles and individual haplotypes.  We validate the method via simulations and controlled experiments, and apply it to Pf3k data set, consisting of 2,344 isolates from 13 countries.  Rates of mixed infection vary from 18\% to 63\% across countries and correlate with independent estimates of parasite prevalence (Pearson $r = 0.59$, P$=3.8e-6$).We find that 55\% of dual infections contain sibling strains likely to have been co-transmitted from a single mosquito. Moreover, 51\% of all mixed infections involve more than two strains. We found that relatedness among strains decreases with prevalence ($r = -0.43$, P$=3.0e-3$) and differs between continents, with Asian isolates typically showing higher relatedness than their African counterparts. Capitalising on \textit{in silico} simulations, we classify isolates carrying two strains according to the most likely number of meiosis that separate them. We conclude that monitoring spatial and temporal patterns of mixed infection and relatedness between strains will be highly informative in pathogen surveillance and assessment of interventions.

\section{Introduction}


Individuals infected with malaria-causing parasites of the genus {\it Plasmodium} often carry multiple, distinct strains of the same species ~\citep{Bell2006}.  Such mixed infections are likely indicative of intense local exposure rates, being common in regions of Africa with high rates of prevalence~\citep{Bhatt2015, Howes2016}. However, they have been documented for {\it P.~vivax} and other malaria-causing parasites~\citep{Mueller2007, Collins2012}, even in regions of much lower prevalence~\citep{Howes2016, Steenkeste2010}.  Mixed infections have been associated with increased disease severity \citep{deRoode2005} and also facilitate the generation of genomic diversity within the parasite, enabling co-transmission to the mosquito vector where sexual recombination occurs \citep{Mzilahowa2007}.  Mixed infections are transient \citep{Bruce2002, Zimmerman2004}, but little is known about the distribution of their duration. Whether the clearance of one or more strains results purely from host immunity~\citep{Borrmann2011} or can be influenced by interactions between the distinct strains~\citep{Enosse2006, Bushman2016}, are also open questions.

Although mixed infections can be studied from genetic barcodes~\citep{Galinsky2015} or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)~\citep{Jack2016}, genome sequencing provides a more powerful approach for detecting mixed infections~\citep{Chang2017}.  Genetic differences between co-existing strains manifest as polymorphic loci in the sequence of the isolate. The higher resolution of sequencing data allows the use of statistical methods for estimating the number of distinct strains, their relative proportions, and genome sequences~\citep{Zhu2017}.  Although genomic approaches cannot identify individuals infected multiple times by identical strains, and are affected by sequencing errors and problems of incomplete or erroneous reference assemblies, they provide a rich characterisation of within host diversity~\citep{Manske2012}.

Previous research has highlighted that co-existing strains can be highly related~\citep{Nair2014, Trevino2017}.  For example, in {\it P. vivax}, 58\% of mixed infections show long stretches of within host homozygosity~\citep{Pearson2016}. In addition, \citet{Nkhoma2012} reported an average of 78.7\% {\it P. falciparum} allele sharing in Malawi and 87.6\% sharing in Thailand. This could result from co-infection by sibling strains where a mosquito vector has acquired several strains from biting multiple infected individuals, a single individual infected by more than one strain, or a combination of the two.  Alternatively, higher levels of relatedness can occur when population diversity is low, such as during the early stages of an outbreak or following severe population bottlenecks. Extensive relatedness has also been observed at the population level.  For example, following a malaria control intervention in Senegal~\citep{Mouzin2010}, haplotype diversity within isolates decreased as a consequence of the induced population bottleneck~\citep{Wong2017}.

The rate and relatedness structure of mixed infections are clearly relevant for understanding regional epidemiology.  However, progress towards utilising this source of information is limited by three problems.  Firstly, while strain deconvolution within mixed infections has received substantial attention~\citep{Galinsky2015, Jack2016, Chang2017, Zhu2017}, joint deconvolution of strains and estimation of relatedness has not been attempted.  Because existing deconvolution methods assume equal relatedness along the genome, differences in relatedness that occur, for example, through infection by sibling strains can lead to errors in the estimation of the number, proportions and sequences of individual strains (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}).  Recently, progress has been made in the case of dual-infections with balanced proportions~\citep{Henden2016}, but a general solution is lacking.  The second limitation is that little is known about how the rate and relatedness structure of mixed infections relates to underlying epidemiological parameters.  Informally, mixed infections will occur when prevalence is high; an observation exploited by \citet{Cerqueira2017} when estimating changes in transmission over time.  However, the quantitative nature of this relationship, the key parameters that influence mixed infection rates and how patterns of relatedness relate to infection dynamics are largely unexplored.  Finally, an important, but often overlooked issue is the sampling design.  Malaria parasites may be taken from individuals presenting with disease or as part of a surveillance programme.  They are also often highly clustered in time and space.  What the impact of different approaches have on observed genomic variation is not clear.  Nevertheless, because mixed infection rates are likely to respond rapidly to changes in prevalence~\citep{volkman2012}, exploring these issues is an important task.

Here, we develop, test and apply an enhanced method for strain deconvolution, which builds on our previously-published \texttt{DEploid} software.  The method works by separating the process of estimating strain number, proportions, and relatedness (specifically the identity-by-descent, or IBD, profile along the genome) from the problem of inferring genome sequences. This new strategy provides substantial improvements in accuracy under complex settings or when dealing with low coverage data.  We apply this approach to 2,344 isolates of {\it P. falciparum} collected from 13 countries over a range of years [2001-2014], and characterise the rate and relatedness patterns of mixed infections.  We show that country-level rates of mixed infection are highly correlated with estimates of malaria parasite prevalence collected by the Malaria Atlas Project \citep{MAP2017}. Furthermore, we find that levels of IBD are negatively correlated with mixed infection rates, and hence parasite prevalence, but are also influenced by other aspects of local epidemiology, such as recent dramatic changes in transmission. For example, we observe a lower effective number of parasite strains within isolates in Senegal as compared to other Africa countries.


\section{Strain deconvolution in the presence of relatedness}

Existing methods for deconvolution of mixed infections assume that the different genetic strains present in mixed infections are unrelated.  This assumption allows for efficient computation of priors for allele frequencies within samples, either through assuming independence of loci~\citep{Jack2016} or as sequences generated as imperfect mosaics of some (predefined) reference panel~\citep{Zhu2017}.  However, when strains are related to each other, certain allele frequencies are excluded; for example, within a region of IBD for a mixed infection with two strains, only allele frequencies of 0 and 1 are possible.  Because patterns of IBD are likely to vary along the genome, these constraints can cause problems for estimators, which can try to fit complex strain combinations (with relatedness) as simpler configurations (without relatedness).  Below we outline the approach taken to integrating IBD into \texttt{DEploid} and validate the approach.  Further details are provided in the Supplementary Materials.


\subsection{Decoding genomic relatedness among strains}

A common approach to detecting IBD between two genomes is to employ a hidden Markov Model that transitions into and out of IBD states~\citep{Chang2015, Gusev2009, Gusev2011}.  We have generalised this approach for the case of $k$ haploid {\it Plasmodium} genomes (strains). In this setting, there are $2^k$ possible genotype configurations, as each of the $k$ strains can be either reference, i.e. same as the reference genome used during assembly, or alternative at a given locus (we assume all variation is bi-allelic). If each of the $k$ strains constitutes a unique proportion of the infection (and no individual proportion is an additive combination of any of the rest), each genotype configuration will produce a distinct alternative allele frequency (Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}A). This frequency is observed as the fraction of total sequencing reads that are alternative at a given locus in the sequenced infection.

The effect of IBD among these $k$ strains is to limit the number of distinct genotype configurations possible, in a way that depends on the pattern of IBD sharing. Consider that, for any given locus, the $k$ strains in the infection are assigned to $j \leq k$ possible reference haplotypes. IBD exists when two or more strains are assigned to the same haplotype. Under this scenario, the total number of possible patterns of IBD sharing for a given $k$ is equal to $\sum_{j=1}^{k} S(k,j)$ where $S(k,j)$ is the number of ways $k$ objects can be split into $j$ subsets (a Stirling number of the second kind \citep{Ronald1988}). Thus, for two strains, there are two possible IBD patterns (IBD or non-IBD), for three strains there are five configurations (all IBD, none IBD; plus each pairwise IBD possibility), for four strains there are fifteen configurations (see Supplementary Materials), and so on. We omit infections with greater than four strains for reasons of computational efficiency and because they are rarely observed. Finally, for a given IBD sharing pattern, only $2^j$ rather than $2^k$ genotype configurations are possible, thereby restricting the set of alternative allele frequencies.

Recombination can change the pattern of IBD sharing, and hence the alternative allele frequencies, along the genome (Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}B).  For inferring patterns of IBD we assume linkage equilibrium between variants, which speeds up computation, and use a Gamma-Poisson emission model for read counts (see Supplementary Materials).  Population-level allele frequencies are estimated from isolates obtained from a similar geographic region.  Because of the structure of the hidden Markov model, we can compute the likelihood of the strain proportions by integrating over all possible IBD sharing patterns.  Once the number and strain proportions have been estimated, we can then use maximum likelihood and posterior decoding to infer the relatedness structure across the genome (Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}B). To characterise the amount of relatedness, we compute the fraction of the pairwise IBD sharing, as well as extract the N50 segment length. The N50 segment is the 50th quantile of the ordered IBD segment. It behaves in a similar fashion as the median, and is a robust metric for IBD segment length when the data is noisy and causing false IBD breaks to shorten IBD segments.

Unlike our previous work, \texttt{DEploidIBD} infers strain structure in two steps.  In the first we estimate the number and proportions of strains using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC), allowing for IBD as described above.  In the second, we infer the individual genomes of the strains, using the MCMC methodology of~\citet{Zhu2017}, which can account for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between variants, but without updating strain proportions.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Method validation}

We validated \texttt{DEploidIBD} through two experiments with lab controlled {\it in vitro} mixtures and simulated {\it in silico} mixtures from field clonal samples.  First, to test consistency with \texttt{DEploid} \citet{Zhu2017}, we re-analysed the 27 experimental mixtures from \citep{Wendler2015}.  This dataset includes 27 samples of various mixtures of four laboratory parasite lines (3D7, Dd2, HB3 and 7G8; Appendix~\ref{first:app}~Figure~\ref{fig:labMixEffk}).  Allowing for mixtures of up to four strains and using optimal reference panels, we found comparable performance with the single-step \texttt{DEploid} method, with the exception of three strains of equal proportions where LD information is necessary to achieve accurate deconvolution (Appendix~\ref{first:app}~Figure~\ref{fig:labMixEffk}).

To test the accuracy of \texttt{DEploidIBD} in a more realistic setting, we created {\it in silico} mixtures from 212 clonal samples of Asian origin with two proportions (10/90\%, 15/85\%, \dots, 45/55\%, 8 proportion pairs) for 8,070 sites from Chromosome 14.  A further 20 randomly chosen samples were used as the reference panel. In order to compare the accuracy of the two methods at different levels of relatedness, we set 25\%, 50\% and 75\% of the second haplotype to be the same as the first haplotype to mimic scenarios of low, medium and high relatedness. This operation sets a lower limit to the relatedness between two samples. In a lower diversity region like Asia, because of the background relatedness, the actual relatedness is expected to be higher.  To simulate data, we used empirical read depths and drew read counts for the two alleles from binomial proportions.  We inferred strain proportions (summarised by the effective number of strains: $1/\sum w_{i}^{2}$), and haplotypes. Both \texttt{DEploid} and \texttt{DEploidIBD} correctly estimate strain proportions with low relatedness (Figure~\ref{fig:benchmark}A). However, for moderate and high relatedness mixtures, \texttt{DEploid} fails to recover the correct proportion, when the effective number of strains is below 1.72, which happens when the minor strain proportion is below 30\%.

\texttt{DEploidIBD} is a substantial improvement from \texttt{DEploid}. Besides accurately estimating proportions and number of strains, it also infers the IBD segments. We find \texttt{DEploidIBD} accurately infer the N50 segment lengths. However, for the low and moderate related samples, \texttt{DEploidIBD} seems to overestimate the mixture relatedness due to background relatedness (Figure~\ref{fig:benchmark}B). Rates of genotype error are also similar for the two approaches in settings of low relatedness (error rate of 0.4\% per site for 25/75 mixtures and 1.0\% for 45/55 mixtures).  However, for the 25/75 mixtures with high relatedness, genotype error for the non-IBD approach increases to 0.6\%, while error in the IBD approach remains at 0.4\% (Figure~\ref{fig:benchmark}C). Phasing switch errors are comparable between the two methods and decrease with increased relatedness due to the higher homozygosity (Figure~\ref{fig:benchmark}D). In summary, joint inference of IBD profiles and strain haplotypes is expected to improve estimates of strain proportions (and hence haplotypes), particularly in regions with high rates of IBD. Moreover, direct estimates of IBD within mixed infections can be used as an additional feature to characterise isolates.

(A) Relative differences of inferred effective number of strains using \texttt{DEploid} and \texttt{DEploidIBD}. The relative difference is calculated as the difference between inferred and expected effective number of strains divided by the expected value. For example, the effective number of strains is expected to be 1.6 for $25/75$ mixtures and 1.98 for $45/55$ mixtures. \texttt{DEploidIBD} can correctly recover this value when two strains are highly related, where \texttt{DEploid} fails to do so.

\end{figure}

We repeat this experiment with {\it in silico} mixtures from 197 clonal African samples, with mixing proportions of 10/90\%, 25/75\% and 45/55\% for 92,780 sites from Chromosome 14. \texttt{DEploidIBD} provides correct estimates for proportions at all relatedness levels (Figure~\ref{fig:benchmark}--Supplement~1) in Africa {\it in silico} mixtures, although with a greater relative difference in effective $K$ compare to Asia ($\sim$ 2\% vs. $\sim$ 1\%). \texttt{DEploidIBD} recovers correct level of relatedness as well as robust N50 estimates. Due to low background relatedness, pairwise relatedness show less variation in Africa compare to Asia. Given that we have used 11 times more SNPs in African {\it in silico} mixtures, both genotype and switch errors are greater than Asian mixtures in count numbers. However, African mixtures have lower error rate per nucleotide, for example, genotype errors below 1\%.

We extend the accuracy test in more complicated settings to Asian {\it in silico} mixtures with three strains. In this experiment, we assume strain three is the dominate strain. We then consider two scenarios: 5 cases that the other two strains have equal proportions of ($0.1, 0.15, \dots, 0.3$) and 10 cases that all three strains have unequal proportions: (0.10, 0.15, 0.75), (0.10, 0.20, 0.70), (0.10, 0.25, 0.65), (0.15, 0.20, 0.65), (0.10, 0.30, 0.60), (0.15, 0.25, 0.60), (0.10, 0.40, 0.50), (0.15, 0.30, 0.55), (0.20, 0.25, 0.55) and (0.20, 0.30, 0.50) (Figure~\ref{fig:benchmark}--supplement~2). We mimic one particular relatedness profile in this experiment: By making the first half of the first strain the same as the dominate strain, and the second half of the second strain the same as the dominate strain. Therefore, even though all the mixtures have three strains. It only presents two haplotypes at any part of the genome. We find that \texttt{DEploidIBD} outperforms (lower relative difference) \texttt{DEploid} in all cases, and provides robust proportion estimates (Figure~\ref{fig:benchmark}--Supplement~2). However, the proportion inference struggles for cases of (0.10, 0.40, 0.50) and (0.30, 0.30, 0.40). As a result, it underestimates the pairwise relatedness and N50 segment lengths.




\subsection{Sample collection and data generation}

To investigate how the rate and relatedness structure of mixed infections varies among geographical regions with different epidemiological characteristics, we applied \texttt{DEploidIBD} to 2,344 field samples of {\it P. falciparum} released by the Pf3k project \citep{pf3k}.  These samples were collected under a wide range of studies with heterogeneous designs. The majority of samples were taken from symptomatic individuals seeking clinical treatment. A summary of the data sources is presented in Table~\ref{tab:Pf3k} whereas full details regarding study designs can be found at \url{https://www.malariagen.net/projects/pf3k#sampling-locations},  After variant calling and quality control, we genotyped approximately 1M SNPs across all samples, sequenced to an average read depth of 86 (range 12.6 -- 192.5).  See Supplementary Materials for details on the filters used and data availability. The Pf3k sequences were aligned to the 3D7 reference genome, with SNP calling performed by the GATK pipelines for best practices. We set a QC threshold that made positive and false negative variant calls equally likely \citep{pf3k}. For deconvolution, samples were grouped into geographical regions by genetic similarity; four in Africa, and three in Asia. (Table~\ref{tab:Pf3k}). Reference panels were constructed from the clonal samples found at each region. Since previous research has uncovered severe population structure in Cambodia \citep{Miotto2013}, we stratified samples into West and North Cambodia when performing analysis at the country level. Diagnostic plots for the deconvolution of all samples can be found at \url{https://github.com/mcveanlab/mixedIBD-Supplement} whereas deconvolved haplotypes can be accessed at URL.

\subsection{Mixed infection rate and relatedness varies by geography}

We find substantial variation in the rate and relatedness structure of mixed infections across continents and countries.  Within Africa, rates of mixed infection vary from 18\% in Senegal to 63\% in Malawi (Figure~\ref{fig:mixInfPlot}A). In Southeast Asian samples, mixed infection rates are in general lower, though also vary considerably; from 21\% in Thailand to 54\% in Bangladesh.  Where data for a location is available over multiple years, we find no evidence for significant fluctuation over time (though we note that these studies are typically not well powered to see temporal variation and collection dates are very heterogeneous). We observe that between 5.1\% (Senegal) and 40\% (Malawi) of individuals have infections carrying more than two strains.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Relatedness between samples and populations also varies substantially.  In dual infections, the average fraction of the genome inferred to be IBD ranges from 21\% in Guinea to 59\% in West Cambodia (Figure~\ref{fig:mixInfPlot}B). The mean relatedness inference is robust: it shows very strong correlation (0.95) before and after filtering out samples with poor haplotypes (due to complex mixing or lack of data, deconvolution of 787 samples have at least one low-quality deconvolved haplotype).  Asian populations show, on average, a higher level of relatedness within dual infections (48\%) compared to African populations (29\%).  Levels of IBD in samples with three or more strains are comparable to those seen in dual infections (average IBD being 50\% in Asia and 29\% in Africa) and significantly correlated at the country level (P = 0.0012), except Senegal.  Overall, 53\% of all mixed infections involve strains with over 30\% of the genome being IBD (the 2.5th percentile of the IBD fraction distribution between true siblings, given the recombination rate in {\it P. falciparum}).

In general, we find that populations with higher rates of mixed infection tend to have lower levels of IBD in mixed infections (linear model P = 0.06 after accounting for a continental level difference and weighted by sample size).  However, the continental level effect is driven by Senegal, which has an unusual combination of low mixed infections, but also low IBD.  Excluding this population, we find a consistent pattern across populations (Figure~\ref{fig:mixInfPlot}C), with a strong negative effect of mixed infection rate on level of IBD (P = $3\times10^{-4}$).

The observed levels of IBD suggest that a substantial fraction of mixed infections involve sibling strains; those related through meiosis from distinct parental strains within a multiply-infected mosquito.  Figure~\ref{fig:strainIBD} shows examples of genomic IBD profiles in dual and triple infections.  In lab crosses cross-over events occur typically 200~kb to 1~Mb apart \citet{Miles2016}, hence IBD tracts are expected to be about half this length in dual sibling infections. IBD tracts with such length are common. Although in some cases, segment lengths are longer (Figure~\ref{fig:strainIBD}~A), which suggest that recombination events may have happened among strains from a region with high background relatedness.

\subsection{IBD patterns allow for classification of sibling mixed infections}


The high levels of IBD observed in many mixed infections were suggestive of a sibling relationship between constituent strains. To characterise the expected IBD patterns between siblings, we constructed a meiosis simulator for {\it P. falciparum} ({\tt pf-meiosis}), incorporating salient features of malaria biology that can impact the way IBD is produced in a mosquito and detected in a human host. Most prominently, a single infected mosquito can undergo multiple meioses in parallel --- one occurring for each oocyst that forms on the mosquito midgut.  In a mosquito infected with two distinct strains, each oocyst can be either selfed (the maternal and paternal strain are the same) or outbred (the maternal and paternal strains are different). We model a $k=n$ mixed infection as a sample of $n$ strains (without replacement, as drawing identical strains yields $k=n-1$) from the pool of strains created by all oocysts. Most studies suggest that the distribution of oocysts is roughly exponential with a mean of 1.5, implying that the most common number of oocysts in an infected mosquito is one. Interestingly, in such a case, a $k=2$ infection will have an expected IBD of $1/3$. Conditioning on at least one progeny from an outbred oocyst (such that a detectable recombination event has occurred), the expected IBD asymptotically approaches $1/2$ as the total number of oocysts grows.

Using this simulation framework, we sought to classify observed mixed infections based on their patterns of IBD. We used two summary statistics to perform the classification: mean IBD segment length and IBD fraction. We built distributions for these two statistics for each country in Pf3k, by simulating meiosis between pairs of clonal samples from that country.  In this way, we control for variation in genetic diversity (as latent IBD between clonal samples) in each country. Starting from a pair of clonal samples ($M=0$, where $M$ indicates the number of meioses that have occurred), we simulated three successive rounds of meiosis ($M=1, 2, 3$), representing the creation and serial transmission of a mixed infection (Figure~\ref{fig:classify}A). Each round of meiosis increases the amount of observed IBD, as segregation and recombination allow for portions of identity, generated during DNA replication, to end up in the progeny. For example, in Ghana, the mean IBD fraction for $M=0$ was 0.002, for $M=1$ was 0.41, for $M=2$ was 0.66, and for $M=3$ was 0.80 (Figure~\ref{fig:classify}B). West Cambodia, which has lower genetic diversity, had a mean IBD fraction of 0.08 for $M=0$ and consequently, the mean IBD fractions for higher values of $M$ were slightly increased, to 0.46, 0.68, 0.81 for $M=1, 2$ and $3$, respectively (Figure~\ref{fig:classify}B).

From these simulated distributions, we used Naive Bayes to classify all $k=2$ mixed infections in Pf3k (Figure~\ref{fig:classify}C).  Of the 404 samples with $k=2$, 288 (71\%) had IBD statistics that fell within the range observed across all simulated $M$. Interestingly, more than half (221, 55\%) of all $k=2$ mixed infections were classified as siblings ($M > 0$, with > 99\% likelihood).  Moreover, we observe evidence for geographical differences in the rate at which sibling and unrelated mixed infections occur. Notably, in Asia, a greater fraction of all mixed infections contained siblings (65\% vs. 51\% in Africa), driven by a pronouncedly higher frequency of $M=2$ and $M=3$ mixed infections (Figure~\ref{fig:classify}D).

\subsection{Characteristics of mixed infections correlate with local parasite prevalence}


To assess how characteristics of mixed infection relate to local infection intensity, we obtained estimates of {\it P. falciparum} prevalence from the MAP (Table~\ref{tab:Pf3k}). The country level prevalence estimates range from 0.01\% in Thailand to 55\% in Ghana, with African countries having over two orders of magnitude greater average infection intensity (mean of 30\% in Africa and 0.4\% in Asia). However, seasonal and geographic fluctuations in prevalence mean that, conditional on sampling an individual with malaria, local prevalence may be much higher than the longer-term (and more geographically widespread). We summarise mixed infection rates by the average effective number of strains, which reflects both the number and proportion of strains present.  This metric both avoids the problem of having to determine a threshold for determining the presence of a very low proportion strain and is sensitive to the presence of triply (and more) infected samples.

After accounting for between-continent differences in prevalence, the effective number of strains is a significant predictor of local prevalence (linear model $P = 5.5 \times 10^{-5}$), though the level of relatedness is not ($P>0.17$), either by itself or in combination with the rate of mixed infection (Figure~\ref{fig:model}).  The relationship between the effective number of strains and prevalence is driven entirely by the African populations ($P = 1.9\times10^{-3}$). Within the Asian populations,  the effective number of strains is an extremely poor predictor of country-level prevalence ($P = 0.44$).


\begin{figure}[ht]

Point shape indicates country and colour indicates the average level of IBD observed within mixed infections. Point size is proportional to Pf3k sample size.}
  \label{fig:model}
\end{figure}

%One feature stands out from this analysis: Given the (negative) association between mixed infection rate and levels of IBD, it seems unexpected that levels of IBD do not correlate with prevalence in Asia but this could be partially explained by the marked differences in the distribution of background IBD among countries (i.e. relatedness between strains found in different isolates).


%To better understand the expected relationships between pathogen prevalence and statistics of infection, we developed a simple extension of the classic Ross-MacDonald model \citep{Smith2012} of malaria transmission to include mixed infection within both hosts and vectors (Figure~\ref{fig:model}). In this deterministic model, we assume a fixed number of hosts and vectors, that infection status does not affect probability of transmission or sampling and that the bottlenecks at transmission to host or vector can be approximated as a single parameter that determines the probability that a multiply-infected host (or vector) transmits more than one strain (if they are themselves multiply-infected.  See Supplementary Material for model details.  At equilibrium, this model recovers the standard relationship between vector density and/or biting rate and local prevalence: $\pi = (\lambda_H - \gamma \xi)/(\lambda_H + \lambda \xi)$, where $\lambda_H$ is the expected number of bites per host per day that could lead to infection, $\gamma$ is the rate of host clearance, and $\xi$ is the rate of vector replacement (or clearance) .  However, in addition, we  can predict how mixed infection rates covary with prevalence and, in addition, approximate the relative contribution of sib-infections by comparing the contribution to novel mixed infections, at equilibrium, from previously uninfected hosts (hence infected by a single multiply-infected mosquito, assumed to transmit sibling strains, occurring at rate $H_0 V_M \lambda_H \phi$) and from previously singly-infected strains (hence carrying at least two distinct strains, occurring at rate $H_1 (V_1 + V_M) \lambda_H$).  This model has several limitations, for example not being able to model background levels of relatedness, but nevertheless serves as a useful indicator of how more complex and realistic models might behave.  We note that the model does not consider the effective number of strains directly, however, we expect a monotonic relationship with mixed infection rate.%

%Analysis of the model reveals two features.  First, by altering the vector population, the rate of mixed infection tracks prevalence in a largely linear manner, though at high prevalence, there is a somewhat greater than linear relationship, see Figure~\ref{fig:model}b.  Second, the relative contribution of sibling strains (compared to unrelated strains) in mixed infections is relatively constant across varying prevalence, with the exception of a  high contribution at very low prevalence (Figure~\ref{fig:model}b).  These observations are consistent with the genomic data presented here (Figure~\ref{fig:model}), where we see significant correlation between prevalence and mixed infection, but no significant correlation with relatedness in mixed infections (despite the negative correlation between mixed infection rate and IBD fraction).  Figure~\ref{fig:model}b shows a choice of parameter values that broadly match the empirical data.  These results suggest that rates of mixed infection are likely to be highly informative about the local intensity of {\it P. falciparum} transmission.  In contrast, the relative contribution of sibling infection to mixed infections reflects fundamental parameters relating to transmission events.%


\section{Discussion}

Genome sequencing of malaria parasites obtained from human hosts has revealed many striking features of malaria evolution and population structure. Some of these discoveries comprise the repeated origin of artemisinin resistance mutations in South East Asia \citep{miotto2015genetic}, high levels of population differentiation \citep{Miotto2013}, and the presence of many loci that show evidence for adaptive evolution or long-term balancing selection \citep{Network2015}.  However, the extent to which such data can give high resolution information about malaria epidemiology, in both space and time, and thus inform control strategies, is largely unknown.  Here, we have focused on the problem of learning about mixed infections from genome-sequencing data.  Mixed infections have been studied previously \citep{auburn2012characterization, assefa2014estmoi,Galinsky2015, Jack2016}, but the tools developed here enable estimates, not only of the presence of multiple strains, but their proportions, relatedness, and haplotypes.  We have shown that, in the populations studied here, between 18\% and 63\% of isolates have multiple infections, and up to 51\% have more than two.  Perhaps most unexpected, we have also shown that over half of all mixed infections include strains related at the level of siblings, with chromosomal patterns of IBD that indicate progeny from a single infected mosquito.  Even in regions of extremely low average prevalence, such as in parts of South East Asia (for example Vietnam has a mean prevalence of less than 1 in 1,000 \citep{who2017profile,who2017}), where individuals infected with malaria are found, they frequently carry mixed infection (we estimate 31\%) and, again, often with sibling strains (75\% for Vietnam).

%To better understand how observations of characteristics of mixed infection relate to epidemiological processes, we introduced a simple deterministic model for mixed infection.  For a given set of transmission parameters (those relating to the relative chances of transmitting single and multiple strains at host-vector interactions), as vector density increases, so does prevalence and, in a roughly linear manner, the expected mixed infection rate.  Consequently, the order of magnitude differences in prevalence seen between Asian and African populations would be expected to translate into orders of magnitude differences in mixed infection rate. That this is not observed points either to differences in the biology of transmission (for example resulting from differences in vector biology) or to heterogeneity of transmission within Asian populations, with hotspots of transmission (in both space and possibly time). Transmission hotspots are highly seasonal \citep{Ahmed2013}.%

In both Africa \citep{Bejon2010} and Asia \citep{Heng2017}, researchers have identified stable hotspots last for several years and unstable hotspots that disappears after one year or two. Nevertheless, within African populations mixed infection rate is a significant predictor of country-level prevalence, suggesting that the metric is a potentially useful source of information for measuring local transmission intensity.  We note that Senegal, where there has been a dramatic reduction in malaria prevalence \citep{Daniels2015}, is an outlier in terms of this metric within Africa (Figure~\ref{fig:mixInfPlot}).

%While many individuals with malaria carry mixed infections, in the majority of cases the parasite strains are related, often at the level of siblings or even greater.  That sibling strains are frequently observed (we estimate XX \% of all mixed infections) indicates that the transmission bottleneck from vector to host is relatively weak.  One route by which \'supersib\' infections could occur (i.e. sibs from parents that are themselves related) is through onward transmission of sibling strains in a host to a vector, with subsequent meiosis and transmission to a new host. Thus a single mosquito that acquired two distinct malaria strains through biting multiple infected hosts could potentially generate a chain of mixed infections, with increasing levels of IBD.  Such events are likely to play an important role particularly in low transmission settings, which is consistent with our observations of higher levels of IBD in Asian populations.  More generally, we can estimate relatedness both within infections and between infections as a route to identify groups of individuals that likely represent transmission chains.%


The approach presented here, combined with population-scale sequencing of pathogen genomes from those infected with malaria parasites, offers new tools for control programmes.  We have shown that simple metrics of mixed infection rate are predictive of current local prevalence and that relatedness patterns provide additional information about local dynamics.  However, there are many challenges to providing robust and meaningful predictions.  Perhaps most importantly, sampling strategies for obtaining pathogen genomes are likely to bias information in space and time.  The extent to which this will be problematic for quantitative inference is unknown and requires further investigation.  Other complications, such as whether the vector or host exerts a selective force on mixed infections that is distinct from single infections, or how prior (or current) infection influences the chances of subsequent infection, will also be important to determine to achieve better understanding of the mixed infection process.


\section{Discussion - Updated}

It has long been appreciated that mixed infections are an integral part of malaria biology, yet deconvoluting these infections -- determining the number, proportions and haplotypes of the strains that comprise them -- has proven a formidable challenge.  Previously we published \texttt{DEploid}, the first algorithm to provide such a description of a mixed infection. Yet, in cases where mixed infections contained highly related strains, \texttt{DEploid} struggled to deconvolve strains of less than 30\%
relative abundance in a related mixture. Critically, mixed infections containing highly related strains represent an of-interest epidemiological scenario: being likely produced from a single mosquito bite, wherein meiosis has occurred between strains. Thus, we extended our approach and developed \texttt{DEploidIBD}, capable not only of deconvoluting highly related mixed infections, but also providing a profile of that relatedness through a list of all IBD segments present in the infection.

Though DEploidIBD has significantly widened our window into mixed infections, challenges still remain. These challenges include technical difficulties when extracting and separate sequences if there are multiple species; as well as sequencing challenges which leads to poor mapping quality and low-coverage data.

Despite remaining challenges, the application of \texttt{DEploidIBD} to the 2,344 samples in the Pf3k project has opened the door on a wealth of new malaria biology. Firstly, it has re-emphasized the importance of deconvoluting mixed infections: we find that 1026 (44\%) of all samples in Pf3k were mixed, being comprised of 505 $k=2$ infections, 374 $k=3$ and 147 $k=4$ infections. Indeed, across the entire dataset, the total number of genomes extracted from mixed infections is more than double the number extracted from clonal infections (2720 genomes from $k>1$ vs. 1318 in $k=1$).

Not only are mixed infections ubiquitous, but the rate at which they occur exhibits considerable variation, between continents, but also between countries -- suggesting it may be sensitive to local epidemiology.  For example, in West Africa, Senegal (which has undergone a recent and effective malaria control campaign) has a rate of mixed infections less than half that of neighbouring Guinea and Mali.  Previous work has highlighted the utility of mixed infection rate in discerning changes in regional prevalence, and we re-enforce that finding here, observing a significant correlation between the effective number of strains and parasite prevalence across Pf3k collection sites. Similarly, using \texttt{DEploidIBD} we also observe significant geographical variation in the relatedness profiles of strains within mixed infections.  Interestingly, this variation is structured such that regions with high rates of mixed infection tend to contain strains that are less related, yielding a significant negative correlation between mixed infection rate and mean relatedness within those infections.

Extracting relatedness profiles from mixed infections, in the form of a list IBD segments across the genome, is a key output of \texttt{DEploidIBD}, and a potential key into transmission micro-epidemiology. Consider that mixed infections in  hosts can be sub-divided into two classes based on the nature of the biting events that produced them; a mixed infection of $k$ strains can be produced by (1) $k$ infectious bites or by (2) $j < k$ infections bites. In the first case, parasites are delivered by separate vectors and no meiosis occurs between them, thus any IBD observed in the mixed infection pre-existed as latent IBD between the individual strains.  In case two, meiosis may occur between parasite strains, as multiple are delivered by a single mosquito.  Meiosis produces additional IBD to any pre-existing IBD, which are observed as a whole in the mixed infection.  The amount of IBD produced by this meiosis is a random variable, dependent on outcomes of meiotic processes, such as the number of and distance between recombination events and the segregation of chromosomes.  Here, we show that the mean IBD produced during meiosis in \textit{P. falciparum} depends also on the number and type (selfed vs outbred) of oocysts existing in the infectious mosquito.  Strikingly, from this insight, it follows that the amount of IBD expected in a single-bite mixed infection produced from two unrelated parasites strains will always be slightly less than $1/2$, and as low as $1/3$.

Critically, we capture this behaviour in a simulation, \texttt{pf-meiosis}, and in conjuction with DEploidIBD, classify individual $k=2$ mixed infections based on their recent transmission history.  We focus on simulating mixed infection transmission chains, whereby an $M=n+1$ mixed infection is produced through onward transmission of and meiosis between the sibling strains in an $M=n$ mixed infection.  Such simulated mixed infection chains can explain the remarkably high IBD observed in many real mixed infections (<insert detail>), as the expected amount of IBD increases along a chain. However, in order for a chain to persist, it must be propagated via an uninfected mosquito to an uninfected host. Consistent with this, we observe markedly more long mixed infection chains ($M>1$) in Asia than in Africa. We suggest that this observation is not a product of lower genetic diversity in Asia, as differences in latent IBD between countries have been controlled for in the generation of $M=0$ mixed infections. Rather, it reflects true differences in transmission epidemiology between continents. In total, we observe that 56\% of all $k=2$ mixed infections in the Pf3k contain sibling strains ($M>0$), suggesting that the transmission bottleneck is relatively weak.

A non-trivial fraction (XX\%) of all mixed infections eluded classification.  We suggest two explanations.  Firstly, our estimate of latent IBD, generated by combining pairs of random clonal samples from a given country into an artificial $M=0$ mixed infection, can be biased. This bias will exist if the way in which mosquitoes sample hosts differs from the way in which samples are collected for Pf3k (which is of course, very likely). Secondly, we focused our simulation efforts on mixed infection transmission chains, at the exclusion of other possibly common transmission histories (such as mixed infections containing cousins). Together, accounting for such phenomenon may sop up many of the unclassified mixed infections; though it remains for this to be demonstrated in future work.

\texttt{DEploidIBD} is our effort to tackle a major remaining problem in malaria genetics: the deconvolution of mixed infections.  To a significant degree we achieve this, applying it to the largest available collection of global \textit{P.falciparum} samples currently in existence.  We show that extracting information from mixed infections will not only allow for a deeper understanding of malaria biology -- most fundamentally, a cataloguing of the routes by which individuals end up carrying multiple parasite strains in the first place -- but can also inform on malaria transmission epidemiology, in ways that could perhaps lend themselves to global efforts to control and eradicate the disease.
