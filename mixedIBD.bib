	abstract = {Infections with the malaria parasite {\it Plasmodium falciparum} typically comprise multiple strains, especially in high-transmission areas where infectious mosquito bites occur frequently. However, little is known about the dynamics of mixed-strain infections, particularly whether strains sharing a host compete or grow independently. Competition between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, if it occurs, could be a crucial determinant of the spread of resistance. We analysed 1341 {\it P. falciparum} infections in children from Angola, Ghana and Tanzania and found compelling evidence for competition in mixed-strain infections: overall parasite density did not increase with additional strains, and densities of individual chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) and chloroquine-resistant (CQR) strains were reduced in the presence of competitors. We also found that CQR strains exhibited low densities compared with CQS strains (in the absence of chloroquine), which may underlie observed declines of chloroquine resistance in many countries following retirement of chloroquine as a first-line therapy. Our observations support a key role for within-host competition in the evolution of drug-resistant malaria. Malaria control and resistance-management efforts in high-transmission regions may be significantly aided or hindered by the effects of competition in mixed-strain infections. Consideration of within-host dynamics may spur development of novel strategies to minimize resistance while maximizing the benefits of control measures.},

In a recent trial conducted in children younger than age five in southern Mozambique, the vaccine demonstrated significant and sustained efficacy against both infection and clinical disease. In a follow-up study to the main trial, breakthrough infections identified in the trial were examined to determine whether the distribution of csp sequences was affected by the vaccine and to measure the multiplicity of infecting parasite genotypes.DesignP. {\it falciparum} DNA from isolates collected during the trial was used for genotype studies.SettingThe main trial was carried out in the Manhiça district, Maputo province, Mozambique, between April 2003 and May 2004.ParticipantsChildren from the two cohorts of the main trial provided parasite isolates as follows: children from Cohort 1 who were admitted to hospital with clinical malaria; children from Cohort 1 who were parasite-positive in a cross-sectional survey at study month 8.5; children from Cohort 2 identified as parasite-positive during follow-up by active detection of infection.OutcomeDivergence of DNA sequence encoding the CSP T cell–epitope region sequence from that of the vaccine sequence was measured in 521 isolates. The number of distinct {\it P. falciparum} genotypes was also determined.ResultsWe found no evidence that parasite genotypes from children in the RTS,S/AS02A arm were more divergent than those receiving control vaccines. For Cohort 1 (survey at study month 8.5) and Cohort 2, infections in the vaccine group contained significantly fewer genotypes than those in the control group, (p = 0.035, p = 0.006), respectively, for the two cohorts. This was not the case for children in Cohort 1 who were admitted to hospital (p = 0.478).ConclusionsRTS,S/AS02A did not select for genotypes encoding divergent T cell epitopes in the C-terminal region of CSP in this trial. In both cohorts, there was a modest reduction in the mean number of parasite genotypes harboured by vaccinated children compared with controls, but only among those with asymptomatic infections.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT00197041},

abstract={Most malaria infections contain complex mixtures of distinct parasite lineages. These multiple-genotype infections (MGIs) impact virulence evolution, drug resistance, intra-host dynamics, and recombination, but are poorly understood. To address this we have developed a single-cell genomics approach to dissect MGIs. By combining cell sorting and whole-genome amplification (WGA), we are able to generate high-quality material from parasite-infected red blood cells (RBCs) for genotyping and next-generation sequencing. We optimized our approach through analysis of >260 single-cell assays. To quantify accuracy, we decomposed mixtures of known parasite genotypes and obtained highly accurate (>99\%) single-cell genotypes. We applied this validated approach directly to infections of two major malaria species, {\it Plasmodium falciparum}, for which long term culture is possible, and Plasmodium vivax, for which no long-term culture is feasible. We demonstrate that our single-cell genomics approach can be used to generate parasite genome sequences directly from patient blood in order to unravel the complexity of P. vivax and {\it P. falciparum} infections. These methods open the door for large-scale analysis of within-host variation of malaria infections, and reveal information on relatedness and drug resistance haplotypes that is inaccessible through conventional sequencing of infections.},

	abstract = {Malaria infections containing multiple parasite genotypes are ubiquitous in nature, and play a central role in models of recombination, intra-host dynamics, virulence, sex ratio, immunity and drug resistance evolution in Plasmodium. While these multiple infections (MIs) are often assumed to result from superinfection (bites from multiple infected mosquitoes), we know remarkably little about their composition or generation. We isolated 336 parasite clones from eight patients from Malawi (high transmission) and six from Thailand (low transmission) by dilution cloning. These were genotyped using 384 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, revealing 22 independent haplotypes in Malawi (2{\textendash}6 per MI) and 15 in Thailand (2{\textendash}5 per MI). Surprisingly, all six patients from Thailand and six of eight from Malawi contained related haplotypes, and haplotypes were more similar within- than between-infections. These results argue against a simple superinfection model. Instead, the observed kinship patterns may be explained by inoculation of multiple related haploid sporozoites from single mosquito bites, by immune suppression of parasite subpopulations within infections, and serial transmission of related parasites between people. That relatedness is maintained in endemic areas in the face of repeated bites from infected mosquitoes has profound implications for understanding malaria transmission, immunity and intra-host dynamics of co-infecting parasite genotypes.},

Results from this method are consistent with previous approaches but provide finer resolution of these mixtures.

As such, it is important to understand the dynamics of resistance by investigating population structure, natural selection and disease transmission in microorganisms. The study of disease dynamics has been hampered by the lack of suitable statistical models for analysis of isolates containing multiple infections. We introduce a statistical model that uses population genomic data to identify genomic regions (loci) that are inherited from a common ancestor, in the presence of multiple infections. We demonstrate its potential for biological discovery using a global Plasmodium falciparum dataset. We identify low genetic diversity in isolates from Southeast Asia, possibly from clonal expansion following intensified control efforts after the emergence of artemisinin resistance. We also identify loci under positive selection, most of which contain genes that have been associated with antimalarial drug resistance. We discover two loci under strong selection in multiple countries throughout Southeast Asia and Africa where the selection pressure is currently unknown. We find that the selection pressure at one of these loci has originated from gene flow, while the other loci has originated from multiple independent events.},

Unlike methods with comparable objectives, GERMLINE scales linearly with the number of samples, enabling analysis of whole-genome data in large cohorts. Our approach is based on a dictionary of haplotypes that is used to efficiently discover short exact matches between individuals. We then expand these matches using dynamic programming to identify long, nearly identical segmental sharing that is indicative of relatedness. We use GERMLINE to comprehensively survey hidden relatedness both in the HapMap as well as in a densely typed island population of 3000 individuals. We verify that GERMLINE is in concordance with other methods when they can process the data, and also facilitates analysis of larger scale studies. We bolster these results by demonstrating novel applications of precise analysis of hidden relatedness for (1) identification and resolution of phasing errors and (2) exposing polymorphic deletions that are otherwise challenging to detect. This finding is supported by concordance of detected deletions with other evidence from independent databases and statistical analyses of fluorescence intensity not used by GERMLINE.},

abstract={The malaria parasite {\it Plasmodium falciparum} has a great capacity for evolutionary adaptation to evade host immunity and develop drug resistance. Current understanding of parasite evolution is impeded by the fact that a large fraction of the genome is either highly repetitive or highly variable and thus difficult to analyze using short-read sequencing technologies. Here, we describe a resource of deep sequencing data on parents and progeny from genetic crosses, which has enabled us to perform the first genome-wide, integrated analysis of SNP, indel and complex polymorphisms, using Mendelian error rates as an indicator of genotypic accuracy. These data reveal that indels are exceptionally abundant, being more common than SNPs and thus the dominant mode of polymorphism within the core genome. We use the high density of SNP and indel markers to analyze patterns of meiotic recombination, confirming a high rate of crossover events and providing the first estimates for the rate of non-crossover events and the length of conversion tracts. We observe several instances of meiotic recombination within copy number variants associated with drug resistance, demonstrating a mechanism whereby fitness costs associated with resistance mutations could be compensated and greater phenotypic plasticity could be acquired.},

    abstract = {Author Summary The memory component of acquired immune responses selects for distinctive patterns of polymorphism in genes encoding important target antigens of pathogens. These are detectable by surveying for evidence of balancing selection, as previously illustrated in analyses of genes encoding malaria parasite antigens that are candidate targets of naturally acquired immunity. For a comprehensive screen to discover targets of immunity in the major human malaria parasite {\it Plasmodium falciparum}, an endemic population in West Africa was sampled and genome sequence data obtained from 65 clinical isolates, allowing analysis of polymorphism in almost all protein-coding genes. Antigen genes previously studied by capillary re-sequencing in independent population samples had highly concordant indices in the genome-wide analysis here, and this has identified other genes with stronger evidence of balancing selection, now prioritized for functional study and potential vaccine candidacy. The statistical signatures consistent with such selection were particularly common in genes with peak expression at the stage that invades erythrocytes, and members of several gene families were represented. The strongest signature was in the msp3-like gene PF10_0355, so we studied the transcript and protein product in parasites, revealing an unexpected pattern of phase variable expression. Variation in expression of polymorphic antigens under balancing selection may be more common than previously thought, requiring further study to assess vaccine candidacy.},

Within this relatively small geographical area we have discovered several distinct but apparently sympatric parasite subpopulations with extremely high levels of genetic differentiation. Of particular interest are three subpopulations, all associated with clinical resistance to artemisinin, which have skewed allele frequency spectra and remarkably high levels of haplotype homozygosity, indicative of founder effects and recent population expansion. We provide a catalogue of SNPs that show high levels of differentiation in the artemisinin-resistant subpopulations, including codon variants in various transporter proteins and DNA mismatch repair proteins. These data provide a population genetic framework for investigating the biological origins of artemisinin resistance and for defining molecular markers to assist its elimination.},

abstract = {The current epidemic of artemisinin resistant {\it Plasmodium falciparum} in Southeast Asia is the result of a soft selective sweep involving at least 20 independent \textit{kelch13} mutations. In a large global survey, we find that \textit{kelch13} mutations which cause resistance in Southeast Asia are present at low frequency in Africa. We show that African \textit{kelch13} mutations have originated locally, and that \textit{kelch13} shows a normal variation pattern relative to other genes in Africa, whereas in Southeast Asia there is a great excess of non-synonymous mutations, many of which cause radical amino-acid changes. Thus, \textit{kelch13} is not currently undergoing strong selection in Africa, despite a deep reservoir of variations that could potentially allow resistance to emerge rapidly. The practical implications are that public health surveillance for artemisinin resistance should not rely on \textit{kelch13} data alone, and interventions to prevent resistance must account for local evolutionary conditions, shown by genomic epidemiology to differ greatly between geographical regions.},

Such studies are especially difficult to implement when transmission is low, and low transmission is the goal of malaria elimination. Malaria-control efforts in Senegal have resulted in changes in population genomics evidenced by increased allele sharing among parasite genomes, often including genomic identity between independently sampled parasites. Fitting an epidemiological model to the observed data indicates falling transmission from 2006-2010 with a significant rebound in 2012-2013, an inference confirmed by incidence data. These results demonstrate that genomic approaches may help monitor transmission to assess initial and ongoing effectiveness of interventions to control malaria.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Malaria is endemic in 13 of 64 districts of Bangladesh, representing a population at risk of about 27 million people. The highest rates of malaria in Bangladesh occur in the Chittagong Hill Districts, and {\it Plasmodium falciparum} (predominately chloroquine resistant) is the most prevalent species. METHODS: The objective of this research was to describe the epidemiology of symptomatic {\it P. falciparum} malaria in an area of Bangladesh following the introduction of a national malaria control program. We carried out surveillance for symptomatic malaria due to {\it P. falciparum} in two demographically defined unions of the Chittagong Hill Districts in Bangladesh, bordering western Myanmar, between October 2009 and May 2012. The association between sociodemographics and temporal and climate factors with symptomatic {\it P. falciparum} infection over two years of surveillance data was assessed. Risk factors for infection were determined using a multivariate regression model. RESULTS: 472 cases of symptomatic {\it P. falciparum} malaria cases were identified among 23,372 residents during the study period. Greater than 85\% of cases occurred during the rainy season from May to October, and cases were highly clustered geographically within these two unions with more than 80\% of infections occurring in areas that contain approximately one-third of the total population. Risk factors statistically associated with infection in a multivariate logistic regression model were living in the areas of high incidence, young age, and having an occupation including jhum cultivation and/or daily labor. Use of long lasting insecticide-treated bed nets was high (89.3\%), but its use was not associated with decreased incidence of infection. CONCLUSION: Here we show that {\it P. falciparum} malaria continues to be hypoendemic in the Chittagong Hill Districts of Bangladesh, is highly seasonal, and is much more common in certain geographically limited hot spots and among certain occupations.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Cambodia reduced malaria incidence by more than 75\% between 2000 and 2015, a target of the Millennium Development Goal 6. The Cambodian Government aims to eliminate all forms of malaria by 2025. The country's malaria incidence is highly variable at provincial level, but less is known at village level. This study used passive case detection (PCD) data at village level in Ratanakiri Province from 2010 to 2014 to describe incidence trends and identify high-risk areas of malaria to be primarily targeted towards malaria elimination. METHODS: In 2010, the Cambodian malaria programme created a Malaria Information System (MIS) to capture malaria information at village level through PCD by village malaria workers and health facilities. The MIS data of Ratanakiri Province 2010-2014 were used to calculate annual incidence rates by Plasmodium species at province and commune levels. For estimating the trend at provincial level only villages reporting each year were selected. The communal incidences and the number of cases per village were visualized on a map per Plasmodium species and per year. Analysis of spatial clustering of village malaria cases by Plasmodium species was performed by year. RESULTS: Overall, malaria annual incidence rates per 1000 inhabitants decreased from 86 (2010) to 30 (2014). {\it Falciparum} incidence decreased (by 79\% in 2014 compared to 2010; CI 95\% 76-82\%) more rapidly than vivax incidence (by 19\% in 2014 compared to 2010; CI 95\% 5-32\%). There were ten to 16 significant spatial clusters each year. Big clusters tended to extend along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border and along the Sesan River. Three clusters appeared throughout all years (2010-2014): one with 21 villages appeared each year, the second shrunk progressively from 2012 to 2014 and the third was split into two smaller clusters in 2013 and 2014. CONCLUSION: The decline of malaria burden can be attributed to intensive malaria control activities implemented in the areas: distribution of a long-lasting insecticidal net per person and early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Dihydro-artemisinin piperaquine was the only first-line treatment for all malaria cases. No radical treatment with primaquine was provided for Plasmodium vivax cases, which could explain the slow decrease of P. vivax due to relapses. To achieve malaria elimination by 2025, priority should be given to the control of stable malaria clusters appearing over time.

Ross developed two different mathematical models, Macdonald a third, and various “Ross-Macdonald” mathematical models exist. Ross-Macdonald models are best defined by a consensus set of assumptions. The mathematical model is just one part of a theory for the dynamics and control of mosquito-transmitted pathogens that also includes epidemiological and entomological concepts and metrics for measuring transmission. All the basic elements of the theory had fallen into place by the end of the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP, 1955–1969) with the concept of vectorial capacity, methods for measuring key components of transmission by mosquitoes, and a quantitative theory of vector control. The Ross-Macdonald theory has since played a central role in development of research on mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and the development of strategies for mosquito-borne disease prevention.},

abstract={We introduce a new statistical model for patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among multiple SNPs in a population sample. The model overcomes limitations of existing approaches to understanding, summarizing, and interpreting LD by (i) relating patterns of LD directly to the underlying recombination process; (ii) considering all loci simultaneously, rather than pairwise; (iii) avoiding the assumption that LD necessarily has a "block-like" structure; and (iv) being computationally tractable for huge genomic regions (up to complete chromosomes). We examine in detail one natural application of the model: estimation of underlying recombination rates from population data. Using simulation, we show that in the case where recombination is assumed constant across the region of interest, recombination rate estimates based on our model are competitive with the very best of current available methods. More importantly, we demonstrate, on real and simulated data, the potential of the model to help identify and quantify fine-scale variation in recombination rate from population data. We also outline how the model could be useful in other contexts, such as in the development of more efficient haplotype-based methods for LD mapping.},
